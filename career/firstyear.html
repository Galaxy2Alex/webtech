		<h2>First Trimester</h2>
		<h3>Information Systems in Organisations</h3>
		<p>Ahh Jyoti, it's quite impossible not to like her and her very own perspective on various subjects. Hear teaching style is also quite unique, and some of her anecdotes are legendary. I did quite enjoy her lectures, though occasionally had troubles keeping up. The tutorials with Kendall were also okay, but the thing I enjoyed most were the practicals with Simventure.</p>
		<h4>Grades</h4>
		
		<h3>Computer Systems</h3>
		<p>I did like Elias, just had some issues grasping some of the material. I completely zoned out when the other lecturer did his lectures, he was not able to properly convey his point throughout the weeks he was in charge.</p>
		<h4>Grades</h4>
		
		<h3>Foundations of Software Development and Design</h3>
		<p>Kevin and Simon, the formidable duo. Due to my previous engagement with Java, I spent most of the time helping other idiots with their problems. I thoroughly enjoyed this module, and would love to do it again.</p>

		<h2>Second Trimester</h2>
		<h3>Human-Computer Inteactions</h3>
		<p>You're not supposed to talk bad about the dead, so I won't comment on this.</p>
		<h4>Grades</h4>
		
		<h3>Programming Fundamentals</h3>
		<p>Didn't allocate enough memory to remember this module.</p>
		<h4>Grades</h4>
		
		<h3>Mathematics for Software Engineering</h3>
		<p>Phew, dodged a bullet with that one. Don't get me wrong, I'm fairly good at maths, just not good at effort. And this module required it. Luckily, I did part of the content in school.</p>
